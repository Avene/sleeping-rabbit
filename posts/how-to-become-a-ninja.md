If you want to be a ninja, you definitely need to watch all epsodes of Ninja Hattori Kun first. Ninja Hattori Kun would tells you everything you need to know to be a great ninja.

Naruto is also good but it's a little bit too aggresive, like Dragon Ball you know.

Also you need to watch Nin-tama Rantaro to get the 100% of courage inside of your heart.
